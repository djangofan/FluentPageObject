FluentPageObject
================

Martin Fowler coined the term “FluentInterface” to describe objects that expose an interface
that flows, and is designed to be readable and concise.  The cost of this fluency is 
additional effort required to design the interface for your object and the slight increase
in complexity.  These types of interfaces are often utilized to create configurations for 
your objects but can progress into an internal Domain Specific Language or DSL.
